## Design Questions

**1. How would you handle duplicate events?**

- To manage duplicates efficiently and process streaming data in real-time, we use AWS Kinesis Data Stream, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. 
- The Kinesis stream captures incoming data, and the Lambda function processes each record, checking for duplicates using DynamoDB.
- This approach ensures only unique data is stored in S3, with DynamoDB acting as a cache to filter duplicates.

**For detailed code logic, refer to the [Detailed Implementation README.md](./scripts/README.md)**

**2. How would you partition the data to ensure good querying performance and scalability?**

### Detailed Partitioning Strategy

#### Amazon S3 Partitioning
Amazon S3 serves as the primary storage layer in your data lake. Proper partitioning of data stored in S3 can significantly enhance query performance and scalability.

##### Partitioning Structure
- **Event Type:** Top-level directory that segregates data based on the type of event. This is useful for quickly narrowing down searches to specific event categories.
- **Event Subtype:** Sub-directory within each event type that further categorizes events. This adds an additional layer of granularity, making it easier to query specific subsets of event types.
- **Year/Month/Day:** Temporal partitioning based on the date the event occurred. This structure supports efficient time-based queries and ensures that data can be easily managed and archived.

##### Example Directory Structure
```
s3://your-bucket-name/event_type/event_subtype/year/month/day/
```

#### Example Breakdown
- **event_type:** Type of the event (e.g., "account", "lesson", "payment").
- **event_subtype:** Further categorization within each event type (e.g., "created", "started", "order").
- **year/month/day:** Temporal partitions to organize data chronologically.

#### Benefits of This Partitioning Strategy
1. **Improved Query Performance:**
   - By organizing data into partitions, queries can be directed to specific directories, reducing the amount of data scanned.
   - Temporal partitioning allows efficient time-range queries, which are common in analytical workloads.

2. **Scalability:**
   - This hierarchical partitioning scheme allows the data lake to grow efficiently without compromising performance.
   - New partitions can be added dynamically as new event types or dates are encountered, supporting continuous data ingestion.

3. **Data Management:**
   - Facilitates easier data management tasks such as data lifecycle policies, backups, and archival.
   - Data can be easily purged or archived based on time-based partitions.

### Glue Data Catalog Partitioning
AWS Glue Crawler will automatically recognize these partitions and add them to the Glue Data Catalog. This metadata catalog will be used to optimize query performance further.

#### Glue Crawler Configuration
- **Schedule:** Set the Glue Crawler to run periodically (e.g., hourly, daily) to keep the metadata up to date with the latest partitions.
- **Classifier:** Use classifiers to correctly interpret the schema of your partitioned data.

### Key Points for Partitioning Strategy
1. **Event Type and Subtype Partitioning:**
   - Allows quick filtering of relevant events.
   - Enhances query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.

2. **Temporal Partitioning:**
   - Supports efficient time-based queries and data management.
   - Facilitates easier data archiving and lifecycle management.

3. **Glue and Databricks Integration:**
   - Glue Crawler and Catalog ensure that partitions are recognized and optimized for query performance.
   - Databricks utilizes these partitions for advanced analytics, ensuring efficient data processing.

By implementing this detailed partitioning strategy, you ensure that your data lake is well-organized, scalable, and optimized for high-performance querying.
